# ExpertSearch

To run the code, run the following command from `ExpertSearch` (tested with Python2.7 on MacOS and Linux):

`gunicorn server:app -b 127.0.0.1:8095` 

The site should be available at http://localhost:8095/

## Improvements
As part of the improvements, we added 3 components to the system (see proposal [here](https://github.com/bashirpartovi/CourseProject)). Below you can find source code and the documentation.

### Source Code and Documentation
Each component includes instructions on how to setup and run 
* [Bio Page Classifier](https://github.com/bashirpartovi/BioPageClassifier)
* [Automated Crawler](https://github.com/chmvkalyan/ExpertSearchCrawler)
